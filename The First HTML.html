        O-space sucks. It’s uncomfortable to use, yet we are pushed to keep using it. Calling it an online portfolio is an overstatement, because we'd be embarassed to show it to any friend, let alone employer. Not only that, but it makes us feel like our school is not concerned with surrounding its students with good design. Nowadays, good design shows customers that they are cared for.
        </p>
        <div class="info">
        <p class="thesolution">
        If we’re going to have an online platform for schoolwork, we want it to not only be comfortable to use, but also to be worthwhile. We want a way to explore eachother’s work, websites, and portfolios. We want a way to share, connect, and critique. We want a way to encourage each other, to share our stressful moments and our happy moments. We don’t want two or three different accounts, we want one cohesive system. But all we really want is for the school to listen to what its students really need, and not carry on with old traditions (and 2006 graphics).
        </p>
        
        <p class="theplan">
        We want to start a digital riot, during which we will cease all use of O-Space until it is redesigned and spproved by us, the students. We will also be removing all of our work from O-Space, essentially emptying it, in order to make an instant impact, as well as to make it easier for the school to take the website and redesign it. If nothing else, we will be freeing ourselves from using O-Space. Literally any way of submitting homework is easier.
        </p>
        
        <p class="therules">
        1. Do not stop doing your homework. Simply avoid submitting it through O-Space. Submit all of your assignments in paper or by email. <br> 2. Do not deface the profiles of non-participating O-Space users. <br> 3. When explaining the situation to a teacher, please do so politely.
