        <p>Hello Craigslist,<br><br>We're the owners of a restaurant in LA looking to expand our daily offerings. We want to stand out in terms of meat choices. Now, before you click away, we are obviously not talking about human meat! We want nothing illegal, so please do not contact us about that. We're hoping to connect with some new sources that could provide us with game meat, like deer, crocodile, snake, moose, and black bear. We are particularly interested in deer and black bear.<br><br>We'd prefer not to mention the name of our restaurant as we want to have a better handle on our marketing prior to revealing this to our customers. If you have worked in the restaurant business, have a hunting and selling license (and are good at both), or know anyone that knows anyone, we would highly value your help.<br><br>We are excited to find new people to do business with who are at least somewhat environmentally minded--or at least remove the bullets from the meat (what a pain that's been!) We can compensate you for any help that is useful to us. Please email. Thanks!<br><br>-Pamela<br><br>EDIT: We have been getting some unpleasant responses regarding meat that is not on our list. Just to clear things up, WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HUMAN MEAT. WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN "MYSTERY" MEAT. WE DO NOT WANT ROADKILL, OR ANIMALS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT TO SLEEP AT THE POUND. What we are looking for is a legal, high-quality supplier of game meats. If you are not exactly that, I do not believe that we need to talk.</p>
