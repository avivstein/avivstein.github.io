        <p>That was not only a very interesting read, but quite an enjoyable one as well--both in terms of content and aesthetic. Before I say anything about it, I want to thank you for bringing it to us--and on the very first assignment! Although I do not have much experience with web design yet (which makes his points feel a little too far to conceptually apply to any projects), I definitely appreciated the examples and links to other websites that Frank Chimero has provided within the text. I have bookmarked some of them for later inspection. His quick and silent videos were soothing and made their point very well, and his input really drives an idea, rather than simply being a vessel for links and generic theorization. And the way that he broke everything up into short segments that visually differed from one another was excellent, and expanded my perception of the possibilities of blogging and online-writing. No longer does an article have to feel like a digital book, with boring black text on an infinite, white background. Chimera delves into innovations within photography, prototyping, technology, philosophy, and the modern workplace. It's hard to be more specific, because there was so much that interested me in his writing that I feel that I would rather not go into it. I would prefer to further digest it, and for now, move onto the Codecademy part of the homework. But, just know that I will be reading and listening to his other works (like "What Screens Want"), and that I would appreciate any extra links or resources relating to the design of all things digital; books, websites, articles, podcasts, videos, documentaries, etc. Thanks again! Already more interesting than any LAS class I've had so far at Otis!
