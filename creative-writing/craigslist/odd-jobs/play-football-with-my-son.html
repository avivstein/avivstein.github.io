        <p>Hi Craigslist,<br><br>My name is Steven and I am a U.S. Marine Veteran. I was injured during my service and am now in a wheelchair. Have been since '09. This is my first time on Craigslist and I hope someone can help me. I am here for my son, who
is a nice fourteen-year old gentleman. But he is too gentle. He spends his time on the computer in some mining game. I don't know why he is so interested in mining, but what I do know is that unless he's mining for oil it won't help this country one bit. I want you to do what I wish I could do. Teach him to play football. Show him how real men play. If I could, I would, but God has taken that away from me, and maybe I deserve that, but my son? I don't think so. I want my Mathew to have a role model. Someone to look up to. I want someone to teach him the ins and outs of life. I can only do so much in my chair.<br><br>If you are interested in my son, let's meet and talk first. I want to make sure that you will be a good influence. That you're not another miner freak. That you are not a molester. That you are a man of God, a man of your word, and a man in general. All of Mathews friends are girls, and I think they rub off on him--and not in the right way.<br><br>Be his MENtor. We'll talk price when we meet, but I hope you will consider that spending time with him is its own reward. Please call my home phone at 1 (424) 717 - 6914.</p>
