        <p>Having OCD feels very much like being superstitious, except that those superstitions are your very own, and they multiply and evolve over time. <br><br>
            
            At the same time, OCD isn't just a disorder, but an experession and response to fear. Whatever you're worried about is presented to you, day after day, in the smallest details of life.<br><br>
            
            CREATE YOUR OWN SUPERSTITIONS THAT ARE MUCH MOR EREAL
            I've had it since I was eight years old, I realized it was a problem at around eleven, and I decided to fix it at around fourteen. OCD can hide itself very well, 
        it mostly affected micro-decisions. it affected the really small details of my life, like my relationship to objects. </p>
