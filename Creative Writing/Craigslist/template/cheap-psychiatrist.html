        <p>I may not know what I want to do with my life, but one thing I know I don't want to do is spend a couple hundred dollars to figure it out! What the hell? 70 bucks per hour? You know how long it's gonna take to fix me? You don't even want to know unless I can pay for your Maserati! The worse a person is, the more he has to pay, is that how it is? Pricks. I want someone to tell me what to do because they want to, because they care, not because I'm giving them money! I have a lot of issues, people, and I can't be spending money on self-help when I have child-support to take care of. Maybe I should stand on top of a roof and get an hour a day from whoever isn't used to it already, you stupipd fuck! Fuck you!<br><br>Dammit, I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to explode on you like that. I'm a mess! I'm just a mess! I've always had a mess in my room as a child, maybe that's why? DAMMIT WHY DIDN'T I JUST CLEAN MY STUPID ROOM. Now I've got problems. Big problems. My problems have problems. My problems' problems have problems. My ex-wife's ex-husband's boyfriend just found out he's got aids. DO I HAVE FUCKIN AIDS? How am I supposed to find out? Seriously, how does a person know unless he's rich enough to afford a fancy psychiatrist? It's an outrage here!<br><br>Fuck. I'll give you 10 bucks for your precious time you disgusting smartass cunt. fucking idiot piece of shit!! I need your help!!!!!!!!!!!1`!!`</p>
