        <p>Remember Hide and Seek? wasn't that fun when you were a kid? Well, we still think it's fun!<br><br> I'm Jordan Wernmeier, proud founder and co-owner of Big Space in Glendale, California. Big Space is a place where adults (as well as kids) can come together and play those great games that once decorated our meaningless lives! You see, the reason adults stop playing games like Hide and Seek is because they literally outgrow all the best hiding spots. <br><br>It's simple scinece, really. Because we can't fit, we stop playing, and because we stop playing, we become less flexible. You know what kids really think an adult is? A stick. That's right, your little Johnny dosn't see you as a person, but just a big useless stick that'll break if you bend over too much. That's sad. That's really sad. You should be ashamed of yourself! But, I suppose you don't have to be. You can just come to Big Space, "Where The Big Kidz Play!™" (we're still working on that slogan.) <br><br>At Big Space, everything is big enough for adults to fit. We've got teams, a timer, and rockin' tunes! The only things that's missing is to get people to realize that Hide and Seek is a sport. Then and only then will people take us seriously. That's where you come in!<br><br> We've assembled a team to participate in and represent LA County in the first ever 2018 National Hide and Seek Championship, where we'll compete under the strictest rules with some of the country's best players.<br><br> We need an enthusiastic, experienced Seeker to join our team to compete next Spring. A good Seeker needs to have intelligence, awareness of their surroundings, and have basic math skills. You'd be surprised how many people count too quickly and skip some numbers!<br><br>So log on to www.bigspace.com/champtionships/apply and send us your application. We'd love to train with you and move this forward! Eventually, we plan on getting this sport on the Olympics, creating a nation-wide franchise chain of Big Spaces, and maybe even have some action gameshows! <br><br>Seek you later, <br><br>Jordan Wernmeier</p>
