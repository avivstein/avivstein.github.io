        <p>I have this room mate--Chad--with which I have a dilemma. He is hopelessly obese, and I cannot stand to watch him slowly kill himself, and eat away his health--at least without feeling some sort of remorse. That is why I am searching for a capable but affordable enginner-type to modify my refrigerator with the following features:<br><br>- Replace the standard yellowish light with a flashing red one when the fridge's door is opened.<br>- Program the refrigerator to say phrases intended to shame Chad for his eating habits.<br>- Make the door heavier (I know this is a physical modification) so that he gets at least some type of exercise.<br><br>Frankly, I am unsure whether any of this will actually deter him, but I am willing to give it a try. Please email me an estimate and any questions you may have.<br><br>Thank you very much,<br>Edward</p>
