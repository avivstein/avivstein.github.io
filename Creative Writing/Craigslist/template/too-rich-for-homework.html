        <p>Let's cut to the chase--I don't want to do homework and you don't want to do real work. I'm in my senior year of high school and I want to take a year off. My parents won't let me, but they're still paying my allowance, so if you can keep my GPA above a 3.8, you've got a job for a year. At the end of every week I'll send you a check and you'll send me my homework. If you need cash we can work something out. I can pay you $300 per week, which I believe is a good rate for a side-job considering that it's steady for an entire year.<br><br>I need to see your high-school transcripts, some samples of your essay-writing skills, your resume, and a cover letter. I would also like to know your schedule so that I have an idea of how much time you can invest in my studies. We can discuss a higher rate if you can provide me with good study-guides or notebooks so that I really just have to do the bare minimum this year. We never have to meet. In fact, it's better that you don't know me. Let's keep everything digital.<br><br>I expect you to have good work habits and not be a procrastinator. I expect you to read all directions carefully and do good work. Some homework is less important than others. If you need to prioritize some work over others, consult me. If you do not make it
easy for me, I will not make it easy for you. If you cannot keep my GPA where I want it, I will have to find someone else. If, however, you just need a little energy boost, I have a Ritalin prescription that I am willing to share.<br><br>Please email me all of your materials and any questions that you may have. Let this be a great year for the both of us. <br><br>-Bryan<br><br>EDIT: I expect you to have a great attention to detail. For every spelling error I find, I will deduct one dollar from your weekly pay. I'm serious about this, guys.</p>
