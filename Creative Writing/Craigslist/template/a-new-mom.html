        <p>I still live with my mom, but I don't speak to her anymore ever since I found out she spiked my coffee with schizophrenia medication every morning. She no longer wakes me up in the morning, and I don't like the threats my alarm clock makes in the morning. Who even decided it was a good idea to have an alarm clock wake you up by screaming THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE! YOUR SKIN IS GETTING CHARRED! Idiots!<br><br>I want the gentleness of a mother's voice without the backstabbing. Come to the window every morning at 6 and wake me up gently. I would prefer it if you are actually a mother, because I need your voice to be soothing. I am wiiling to give you a dollar in the morning, and a dollar at night (if you can do both, that would be super). I can't really give you much more than that though. I did the math and just that much is like $60 per month! That's crazy! But I'm not gonna talk to my mom, so it's definitely worth it.<br><br>So if any moms out there read this, come to my house and knock on my window. I don't remember the address, but it's right here, so you don't even need directions.</p>
