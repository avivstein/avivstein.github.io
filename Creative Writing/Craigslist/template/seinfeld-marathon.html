        <p>Hey I'm Cassandra, any Seinfeld fans out there? I don't really know where to post this, but I'm just gonna put it here for now. So many people here like Friends. GROSS. You know what I have to say about that? 'NO MORE SOUP FOR YOU!' lol, the soup nazi episode. One of the classics! I'm throwing a big one-person party and thought it'd be fun to double it.<br>So if anyone in my area is a hardcore Seinfeld fan and wants to join me in watching ALL THE EPISODES NON-STOP shoot me a web-mail! (I don't have a phone). I did some math, and we'd be sitting on the couch for 3 days, 18 hours, and 30 minutes! (not including bathroom breaks!) But don't worry, the less we eat and drink, the less we have to go to the bathroom! And if we still want more after that, there's also The Office! That adds another 4 days, 3 hours, and 30 minutes! We can spend a whole week together, on my couch, without food or water, watching our favorite TV shows! Because I have Netflix!<br><br><br><br><br><br>lets die together</p>
