        <p>Hi.<br><br>My name is Annie and im 7 an i played neopets since i was 6. i like it as a career but its not fulfiling. you gotta be rich to have fun. ok if you dont now, nepoets is a game wear you get a pet an you play games an you get money called neopoints (NP for short) an you can spend it on your pet an buy items and stuff. my mom gave it to me instead of a puppy. i respect her desishion, but this is  alot more work! you gotta take care of it or it gets depressed, but the games are so hard. i have a eyrie pet, an i wanted to get a paintbrush to color it so it doesnt be depressed anymore, but my favorite paintbrush is called maraquan paintbrush an it costs like 4 milions of NP. an i only have like 6034 NP. an i was playing since i was 6. but if the iconomy wasn so bad, i wouldnt have so spend so much of my NP on food, ani have a picky pet an it doesnt like some foods. so can i have some neopoints? i can give you my username its anniebellafonte321 you can send me some and i can add you as a friend an i can show you my gallery becaz i collect fish becaz neopia has so many weird fish an you can choose some to have. if your neopet is pretty i can marry you in neopia, but my mom says to marry someone with money. neopoints are also money so i think thats okay too.<br><br>Thank you! </p>
