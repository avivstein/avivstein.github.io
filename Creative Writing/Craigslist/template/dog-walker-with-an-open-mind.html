        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Tom, I'm 31, and I am well aware that what I am asking for is strange. I have this "fantasy" of being walked on a leash. Don't judge, because I'm willing to pay you for it! It's not sexual I don't think, I just want to see what it's like. I'll be wearing normal clothes, and I won't say a single word in English. Here's how I imagine we'd do it:<br><br>-You come to my place, and when I hear you ring the door bell, I'll start walking on my knees. (I'll leave the door open because dogs can't open doors.)<br><br>-You talk to me like a dog, but in a happy way. I'm not looking for a domination experience! A good owner for a good dog! I want you to act like you would with any other dog. If it makes you feel better, think of me as a Golden Retriever.<br><br>-You take me out on a walk around the neighborhood. People will be staring at me but I'm willing to take it. You have to be willing, too. I'm okay if you want to ignore them, I'm okay if you want to talk to them. I won't be listening because I'm a dog.<br><br>-Peeing and pooping: I'm curious, not crazy! I'm not going to defecate in public, but I don't mind if we pretend. I'll put up my leg when peeing, sit when pooping, and I'll have a plastic bag for you to pretend with. There's a park in my neighborhood we can walk to and I have a couple of tennis balls, so we can do that for a bit. When I really need to go I'll just go to my bathroom at home, you don't have to help me with that.<br><br>-After our walk, it's pretty much up to you. I do want this to last the whole day, so feel free to hang out at my place and I'll just do what a dog does at home. I have cable, Netflix, Hulu, a PS3, a PS4, a coffee machine, some books (mostly psychology and DC comics), and a music CD collection (british pop and bluegrass). I'd like for you to pet me sometimes. I understand if you're not comfortable, but as you can see from the picture I'm not that ugly so at least consider it!<br><br>-Food: I made a Turkish dish (mainly meat and carrots) and chopped it into small pieces so that it looks like dog food. It's also a very dry dish, so I'm sure I'll feel what a dog would feel. To get the full experience I want you to put it in a dog bowl I have. I usually eat three times a day, but I think most dogs eat just two, which is good because I want to feel hungry. You are free to eat anything from my fridge, but I am willing to compensate you if you decide to order take-out.<br><br>I would like to meet at around 8 am and for us to spend the day together until perhaps around 8 pm. As for compensation, I was thinking $200 for the day. It's an easy day, if you think about. I just ask that you stay in character. We can discuss any questions you may have either by email or phone. My phone number is (310) 329 - 7982. <br><br>-Tom<br><br>P.S. If we both enjoy it, perhaps we can discuss some type of schedule to do this more often. Maybe you can even name and adopt me!</p>
