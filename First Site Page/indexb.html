        <h3>DEC 17</h3>
        <h1>REDESIGN O-SPACE</h1>
        <h3>BECAUSE DESIGN SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE HIGHER STANDARDS</h3>
        <h3>THE OTIS OWLS</h3>
        <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
        <p>O-space sucks. It’s uncomfortable to use, yet we are 
pushed to keep using it. Calling it an online portfolio 
is a like a bad dad joke that dad keeps forgetting he’s 
already told three times in two days. Not only that, but 
it makes us feel like our school is not concerned with 
surrounding its students with good design. Nowadays, good 
design shows customers that they are cared for.</p>
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>If we’re going to have an online platform for schoolwork, 
we want it to not only be comfortable to use, but also to 
be worthwhile. We want a way to explore eachother’s work, 
websites, and portfolios. We want a way to share, connect, 
and critique. We want a way to encourage each other, to 
share our stressful moments and our happy moments. We don’t 
want two or three different accounts, we want one cohesive 
system. But all we really want is for the school to listen 
to what its students really need, and not carry on with old 
traditions (and 2006 graphics).
</p>
        <h4>THE PLAN</h4>
        <p>We want to start a digital riot, during which we will cease 
all use of O-Space until it is redesigned and spproved by us, 
the students. We will also be removing all of our work from 
O-Space, essentially emptying it, in order to make an instant 
impact, as well as to make it easier for the school to take 
the website and redesign it. If nothing else, we will be 
freeing ourselves from using O-Space. Literally any way of 
submitting homework is easier.</p>
        <h4>THE RULES</h4>
        <p>1. Do not stop doing you homework. Simply avoid submitting 
it through O-Space. Submit all of your assignments in paper 
or by email. <br>

2. Do not deface the profiles of non-participating O-Space 
users.<br>

3. When explaining the situation to a teacher, please do so 
politely.</p>
